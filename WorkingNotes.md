# Dataset
It's been always hard to get a hold of SemEval17 dataset. The servers that are linked to in the official website is down(I wasn't able to login). So I have collected the dataset from multiple github repositories. Here's a description of different folders/files so that I don't forget which data files I have used in the end for experiments and why not others.

1. *data/se14-task4*  
    - This directory contains all the data files for SemEval14 dataset for ABSA task (task-4). 
    - processed directory contains processed datasets. It contains reviews with polarity as positive, negative, and neutral. Reviews with conflict polarity are excluded here.
